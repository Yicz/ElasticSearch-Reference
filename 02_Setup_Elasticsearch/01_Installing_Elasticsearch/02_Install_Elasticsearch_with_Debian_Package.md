## Install Elasticsearch with Debian Package

The Debian package for Elasticsearch can be [downloaded from our website](deb.html#install-deb) or from our [APT repository](deb.html#deb-repo). It can be used to install Elasticsearch on any Debian-based system such as Debian and Ubuntu.

The latest stable version of Elasticsearch can be found on the [Download Elasticsearch](/downloads/elasticsearch) page. Other versions can be found on the [Past Releases page](/downloads/past-releases).

![Note](images/icons/note.png)

Elasticsearch requires Java 8 or later. Use the [official Oracle distribution](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or an open-source distribution such as [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net).

### Import the Elasticsearch PGP Key

We sign all of our packages with the Elasticsearch Signing Key (PGP key [D88E42B4](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xD27D666CD88E42B4), available from <https://pgp.mit.edu>) with fingerprint:
    
    
    4609 5ACC 8548 582C 1A26 99A9 D27D 666C D88E 42B4

Download and install the public signing key:
    
    
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

### Installing from the APT repository

You may need to install the `apt-transport-https` package on Debian before proceeding:
    
    
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

Save the repository definition to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list`:
    
    
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-5.x.list

![Note](images/icons/note.png)

These instructions do not use `add-apt-repository` for several reasons:

  1. `add-apt-repository` adds entries to the system `/etc/apt/sources.list` file rather than a clean per-repository file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`
  2. `add-apt-repository` is not part of the default install on many distributions and requires a number of non-default dependencies. 
  3. Older versions of `add-apt-repository` always add a `deb-src` entry which will cause errors because we do not provide a source package. If you have added the `deb-src` entry, you will see an error like the following until you delete the `deb-src` line: 
    
        Unable to find expected entry 'main/source/Sources' in Release file
    (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)




You can install the Elasticsearch Debian package with:
    
    
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch

![Warning](images/icons/warning.png)

If two entries exist for the same Elasticsearch repository, you will see an error like this during `apt-get update`:
    
    
    Duplicate sources.list entry https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/apt/ ...`

Examine `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch-5.x.list` for the duplicate entry or locate the duplicate entry amongst the files in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` and the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file.

![Note](images/icons/note.png)

On systemd-based distributions, the installation scripts will attempt to set kernel parameters (e.g., `vm.max_map_count`); you can skip this by setting the environment variable `ES_SKIP_SET_KERNEL_PARAMETERS` to `true`.

### Download and install the Debian package manually

The Debian package for Elasticsearch v5.4.3 can be downloaded from the website and installed as follows:
    
    
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.4.3.deb
    sha1sum elasticsearch-5.4.3.deb ![](images/icons/callouts/1.png)
    sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-5.4.3.deb

![](images/icons/callouts/1.png)

| 

Compare the SHA produced by `sha1sum` or `shasum` with the [published SHA](https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.4.3.deb.sha1).

### SysV `init` vs `systemd`

Elasticsearch is not started automatically after installation. How to start and stop Elasticsearch depends on whether your system uses SysV `init` or `systemd` (used by newer distributions). You can tell which is being used by running this command:
    
    
    ps -p 1

### Running Elasticsearch with SysV `init`

Use the `update-rc.d` command to configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up:
    
    
    sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10

Elasticsearch can be started and stopped using the `service` command:
    
    
    sudo -i service elasticsearch start
    sudo -i service elasticsearch stop

If Elasticsearch fails to start for any reason, it will print the reason for failure to STDOUT. Log files can be found in `/var/log/elasticsearch/`.

### Running Elasticsearch with `systemd`

To configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following commands:
    
    
    sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service

Elasticsearch can be started and stopped as follows:
    
    
    sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
    sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service

These commands provide no feedback as to whether Elasticsearch was started successfully or not. Instead, this information will be written in the log files located in `/var/log/elasticsearch/`.

By default the Elasticsearch service doesnâ€™t log information in the `systemd` journal. To enable `journalctl` logging, the `--quiet` option must be removed from the `ExecStart` command line in the `elasticsearch.service` file.

When `systemd` logging is enabled, the logging information are available using the `journalctl` commands:

To tail the journal:
    
    
    sudo journalctl -f

To list journal entries for the elasticsearch service:
    
    
    sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch

To list journal entries for the elasticsearch service starting from a given time:
    
    
    sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch --since  "2016-10-30 18:17:16"

Check `man journalctl` or <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journalctl.html> for more command line options.

### Checking that Elasticsearch is running

You can test that your Elasticsearch node is running by sending an HTTP request to port `9200` on `localhost`:
    
    
    GET /

which should give you a response something like this:
    
    
    {
      "name" : "Cp8oag6",
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "cluster_uuid" : "AT69_T_DTp-1qgIJlatQqA",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "5.4.3",
        "build_hash" : "f27399d",
        "build_date" : "2016-03-30T09:51:41.449Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "6.5.0"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }

### Configuring Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch loads its configuration from the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` file by default. The format of this config file is explained in [_Configuring Elasticsearch_](settings.html).

The Debian package also has a system configuration file (`/etc/default/elasticsearch`), which allows you to set the following parameters:


`ES_USER`| The user to run as, defaults to `elasticsearch`.    
---|--- 
`ES_GROUP`| The group to run as, defaults to `elasticsearch`.     
`JAVA_HOME`| Set a custom Java path to be used.     
`MAX_OPEN_FILES`| Maximum number of open files, defaults to `65536`.     
`MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY`| Maximum locked memory size. Set to `unlimited` if you use the `bootstrap.memory_lock` option in elasticsearch.yml.     
`MAX_MAP_COUNT`| Maximum number of memory map areas a process may have. If you use `mmapfs` as index store type, make sure this is set to a high value. For more information, check the [linux kernel documentation](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) about `max_map_count`. This is set via `sysctl` before starting elasticsearch. Defaults to `262144`.     
`LOG_DIR`| Log directory, defaults to `/var/log/elasticsearch`.     
`DATA_DIR`| Data directory, defaults to `/var/lib/elasticsearch`.     
`CONF_DIR`| Configuration file directory (which needs to include `elasticsearch.yml` and `log4j2.properties` files), defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch`.     
`ES_JAVA_OPTS`| Any additional JVM system properties you may want to apply.     
`RESTART_ON_UPGRADE`| 

Configure restart on package upgrade, defaults to `false`. This means you will have to restart your elasticsearch instance after installing a package manually. The reason for this is to ensure, that upgrades in a cluster do not result in a continuous shard reallocation resulting in high network traffic and reducing the response times of your cluster.   
  
![Note](images/icons/note.png)

Distributions that use `systemd` require that system resource limits be configured via `systemd` rather than via the `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch` file. See [Systemd configuration](setting-system-settings.html#systemd) for more information.

### Directory layout of Debian package

The Debian package places config files, logs, and the data directory in the appropriate locations for a Debian-based system:

Type |  Description |  Default Location |  Setting  
---|---|---|---
**home**| Elasticsearch home directory or `$ES_HOME`| `/usr/share/elasticsearch`|      
**bin**| Binary scripts including `elasticsearch` to start a node and `elasticsearch-plugin` to install plugins| `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin`|      
**conf**| Configuration files including `elasticsearch.yml`| `/etc/elasticsearch`| `path.conf`     
**conf**| Environment variables including heap size, file descriptors.| `/etc/default/elasticsearch`|      
**data**| The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated on the node. Can hold multiple locations.| `/var/lib/elasticsearch`| `path.data`     
**logs**| Log files location.| `/var/log/elasticsearch`| `path.logs`     
**plugins**| Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory.| `/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins`| ``     
**repo**| Shared file system repository locations. Can hold multiple locations. A file system repository can be placed in to any subdirectory of any directory specified here.| Not configured| `path.repo`     
**script**| Location of script files.| `/etc/elasticsearch/scripts`| `path.scripts`  
  
### Next steps

You now have a test Elasticsearch environment set up. Before you start serious development or go into production with Elasticsearch, you will need to do some additional setup:

  * Learn how to [configure Elasticsearch](settings.html). 
  * Configure [important Elasticsearch settings](important-settings.html). 
  * Configure [important system settings](system-config.html).
